### Intrinsic vs Extrinsic AD

.pull-left[

- Extrinsic AD

  - allergic AD; 
  
  - high total serum IgE; 
  
  - classic type; 
  
  - high prevalence (70 - 80%); 
  
  - skin barrier pertubed
]

.pull-right[
- Intrinsic AD

  - late onset
  
  - milder severity
  
  - skin barrier not pertubed
  
  - incidence (~ 20%)
]
